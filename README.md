# Basic layout for MVC with Express and backend user routes, controller and MySql DB. 

## Setup

Go Into the .env file and fill it out with the proper data. The jwt token secret can be any string. Grabbing a random long hex string is a good secret.
**Then:** be sure to add the .env to .gitignore by copying  "```.env```" into the .gitignore file. 

In the mySql database, add a users table with your set up. You will probably have to fix some minor bugs, but they should be listed in the console for you once you start running.
